testbed2_catalog
================

THREDDS catalogs for <http://testbed2.sura.org/thredds>. 


These catalogs are automatically generated by the script testbed2.sura.org:/home/testbed/python/googledoc2thredds/googledoc2thredds.py and then pushed to this github repo. 

The github catalogs are then pulled to testbed2.sura.org:/var/www/thredds_instance/content/thredds/test to populate the catalog. In this way the thredds server can use a specific tagged version or the latest version and the catalogs are version controlled.
